To run this application, just double click on index.htm and it will be running in your default browser.
Logs are also there in console.

Given problem was very interesting as I like making logics and solving riddles, so it was very interesting for me.
In my opinion there was no need to involve backend in this task so I completed this task using simple JS only, tried to keep the things as simple as possible. For Dotnet I am ready for another task.
As per instructions it was a 2,3 hours task so thats why I did not put any unnecessary attention to detail just focused on the goal and made it sure that the I cover all the requirments.
Tried avoiding the collisions and also tried accomodating as much rovers as possible.

If I had time then I would try considering these things, 
first of all instead of hard-coding the input in an array I can add a backend wep API that will take the file stream and can keep it in persistent storage/Queue and whenever it is requested by the client then it can be provided.
Can make the size of this maze dynamic and modular.
Also can show some scores and logs on the GUI.
And it is also possible to parse the CSV/Input data and report the collisions before sending the commands to the rovers.
Moreover, we can also use Signal R and can handle all the Rovers individually. 
Front end can be beautified.
Another idea that I also implemented in start and then converted to this shape is that provide three buttons on the frontend Move, Right, Left.
Thank you,
